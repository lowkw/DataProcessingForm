# DataProcessingForm
The Marlin scientists require a Windows Application to process the data using the Galileo DLL and two LinkedList’s; one for each satellite sensor. The data from each sensor must be read into a simple LinkedList of type “double” and then sorted using a Selection and Insertion sort algorithm. Next, the scientist will enter a value into a search textbox and select a Recursive or Iterative binary search algorithm. Finally, for each of the four algorithms the processing time must be measured and displayed.

The Marlin scientists would like buttons for each action and several display options to examine the raw data and processed information. The application must have a single form that shows all the information from the two sensors. The following features are mandatory:
•	A ListBox to display the data from each Sensor.
•	A ListView with two columns to display the data from both sensors (Sensor A and Sensor B).
•	A numeric input to control the standard deviation (Sigma) and mean (Mu) of the data.
•	A button to load data into the two LinkedLists and then display these LinkedLists in a ListView.
•	A series of buttons to process the sort and search functions.
•	Textbox display for the processing times each sort and search.
